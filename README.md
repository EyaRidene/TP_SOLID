# Software Design Principles Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the application of various software design principles. Each principle is applied to a specific problem domain to illustrate its usage.

## Principles and Examples

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Exercise**: `com.directi.training.ocp.exercise_refactored`
- **Description**: The example demonstrates the application of the Open/Closed Principle by refactoring a resource allocation system to allow for extension without modification.

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Exercise**: `com.directi.training.srp.exercise_refactored`
- **Description**: The example showcases the application of the Single Responsibility Principle by refactoring a class to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- **Exercise**: `com.directi.training.lsp.exercise_refactored`
- **Description**: The example illustrates the Liskov Substitution Principle by refactoring a class hierarchy to ensure that subclasses can be substituted for their superclasses without altering the program's correctness.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- **Exercise**: `com.directi.training.isp.exercise_refactored`
- **Description**: The example demonstrates the Interface Segregation Principle by breaking down a large interface into smaller, more specific interfaces to avoid forcing clients to depend on methods they don't use.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Exercise**: `com.directi.training.dip.exercise_refactored`
- **Description**: The example showcases the Dependency Inversion Principle by decoupling high-level and low-level modules and introducing an abstraction layer to facilitate loose coupling and flexibility.

## Usage

To run the examples, compile the Java files and execute the respective main classes.
